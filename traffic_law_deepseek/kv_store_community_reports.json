    "report_string": "# Priority Vehicles and Traffic Control Community\n\nThis community is centered around priority vehicles (XE ƯU TIÊN) and traffic controllers (NGƯỜI ĐIỀU KHIỂN GIAO THÔNG), with relationships extending to ferry terminals (BẾN PHÀ), floating bridges (CẦU PHAO), and other entities involved in traffic regulation. The community's structure highlights the precedence of priority vehicles in traffic, the role of traffic controllers in directing traffic, and the specific rules governing various entities at ferry crossings and floating bridges.\n\n## Central Role of Priority Vehicles (XE ƯU TIÊN)\n\nPriority vehicles, including ambulances, fire trucks, and military vehicles, are central to this community, enjoying special traffic rights during emergencies. Their precedence at ferry crossings and floating bridges is crucial for timely emergency responses, underscoring their importance in public safety and traffic management.\n\n## Traffic Controllers' Authority (NGƯỜI ĐIỀU KHIỂN GIAO THÔNG)\n\nTraffic controllers play a pivotal role in directing traffic, especially in accommodating priority vehicles during emergencies. Their commands must be obeyed by all road users, highlighting their authority in traffic regulation and the enforcement of traffic laws to ensure smooth and safe traffic flow.\n\n## Ferry Terminals and Floating Bridges as Key Locations\n\nFerry terminals (BẾN PHÀ) and floating bridges (CẦU PHAO) are critical locations within this community, where specific traffic rules apply, especially concerning the precedence of priority vehicles. These locations are points of focus for traffic controllers, emphasizing their role in facilitating the smooth passage of vehicles, particularly during emergencies.\n\n## Regulation of Priority Vehicles by Traffic Police\n\nThe relationship between traffic police (CẢNH SÁT GIAO THÔNG) and priority vehicles underscores the regulatory oversight ensuring that these vehicles can perform their duties without hindrance. This includes escorting priority vehicles and enforcing traffic laws to prioritize their passage, which is vital for emergency response efforts.\n\n## Hierarchy of Vehicle Priority at Crossings\n\nThe community outlines a clear hierarchy of vehicle priority at ferry crossings, with priority vehicles at the top, followed by mail-carrying vehicles (XE CHỞ THƯ BÁO), and then fresh food transport vehicles (XE CHỞ THỰC PHẨM TƯƠI SỐNG). This hierarchy ensures that critical services are prioritized, reflecting the community's focus on public welfare and safety.\n\n## Traffic Controllers' Signals Must Be Obeyed\n\nThe imperative for all road users to obey traffic controllers' signals (HIỆU LỆNH CỦA NGƯỜI ĐIỀU KHIỂN GIAO THÔNG) is a fundamental aspect of this community. This rule ensures that traffic controllers can effectively manage traffic flow, especially in accommodating priority vehicles, thereby preventing potential conflicts and ensuring public safety.\n\n## Special Rules for Overtaking Priority Vehicles\n\nArticle 14 (ĐIỀU 14) of traffic regulations specifically addresses the rules for yielding to priority vehicles during overtaking. This regulation is crucial for preventing accidents and ensuring that priority vehicles can navigate traffic unimpeded during emergencies, highlighting the community's emphasis on safety and efficiency.",

The community also emphasizes the importance of maintaining safe distances and protecting vulnerable road users like pedestrians and disabled individuals.\n\n## Prohibition of overtaking on narrow bridges\n\nOvertaking is strictly prohibited on narrow bridges with a single lane due to limited safety conditions. This rule is crucial to prevent accidents in areas where the infrastructure does not support safe overtaking maneuvers.\n\n## Importance of safe distances during overtaking\n\nMaintaining a safe distance from vehicles ahead and behind is mandatory when overtaking. This ensures that there is enough space to maneuver safely without causing collisions or forcing other vehicles to brake suddenly.\n\n## Protection of vulnerable road users\n\nOvertaking is not allowed when pedestrians or disabled individuals in wheelchairs are crossing the road. This rule prioritizes the safety of the most vulnerable participants in traffic, reducing the risk of accidents.\n\n## Overtaking bans on curves with limited visibility\n\nCurves where visibility is restricted are designated as no-overtaking zones. The inability to see oncoming traffic clearly makes overtaking in these areas highly dangerous and likely to result in head-on collisions.\n\n## No overtaking on two-way roads at hilltops\n\nTwo-way roads at the top of hills are another critical area where overtaking is banned. The limited visibility of oncoming traffic over the crest of the hill poses a significant risk of accidents.\n\n## Priority for emergency vehicles\n\nOvertaking is prohibited when emergency vehicles with priority are present.

This underscores the importance of driver responsibility in maintaining road safety.\n\n## Role of road markings in traffic regulation\n\nRoad markings, or 'Vạch kẻ đường', play a crucial role in guiding and regulating traffic, indicating lane divisions, pedestrian crossings, and other traffic guidance indicators. Their importance is further highlighted by their inclusion in Article 13 of traffic regulations, which mandates lane discipline.\n\n## Priority roads and intersection rules\n\nPriority roads, or 'Đường Ưu Tiên', have right-of-way at intersections, and branch roads must yield to them. This rule is essential for preventing collisions and ensuring the smooth flow of traffic at intersections, including roundabouts or 'Vòng Xuyến', which have special yielding rules.\n\n## Emergency response to traffic accidents\n\nThe initial emergency medical response, or 'Cấp cứu ban đầu', is provided to traffic accident victims, highlighting the community's focus on immediate care for the injured. This is a critical component of the overall traffic safety framework.\n\n## Special considerations for disabled individuals\n\nWheelchairs used by disabled individuals, or 'Xe lăn của người khuyết tật', are given priority at traffic signals, reflecting the community's commitment to inclusivity and safety for all road users.",

The entities are interconnected through regulations, safety measures, and specific roles in road traffic management and emergency responses.\n\n## Central role of Người Lái Xe in road traffic\n\nNgười Lái Xe (drivers) are central to this community, being subject to numerous regulations and responsibilities. They must adhere to traffic laws, ensure vehicle safety, and carry proper documentation. Their compliance is crucial for road safety and the smooth operation of road traffic in Việt Nam.\n\n## Regulatory framework of Giao Thông Đường Bộ\n\nGiao Thông Đường Bộ (road traffic) serves as the regulatory framework that governs all road traffic activities. It sets the rules for speed, distance, and safety measures that drivers and other road users must follow. This framework is essential for maintaining order and safety on the roads.\n\n## Emergency response organizations\n\nOrganizations like Xe Cứu Thương (ambulances) and Xe Hộ Đê (flood control vehicles) play critical roles in emergency responses. They are equipped with specific technologies and operate under special regulations to perform their duties effectively during emergencies, disease outbreaks, and natural disasters.\n\n## Safety measures for vulnerable groups\n\nSpecial safety measures are in place for vulnerable groups such as children under 10 years old (Trẻ Em Dưới 10 Tuổi) and passengers (Hành Khách). These include the use of child safety devices and seat belts, highlighting the community's focus on protecting all road users.\n\n## Transportation of dangerous goods\n\nThe transportation of dangerous goods (Vận Chuyển Hàng Hóa Nguy Hiểm) is strictly regulated, requiring special permits, safety measures, and trained personnel. This reflects the community's awareness of the potential risks associated with such activities and the importance of mitigating them.\n\n## Technological aids in road safety\n\nTechnologies like Tín Hiệu Còi (vehicle horns) and Đèn Cảnh Báo Màu Vàng (yellow warning lights) are used to enhance road safety. Their usage is regulated to ensure they serve their purpose without causing disturbances, especially in densely populated areas.\n\n## Role of densely populated areas in traffic regulations\n\nDensely populated areas (Khu Đông Dân Cư) have specific traffic rules regarding lighting and horn usage. These rules are designed to minimize disturbances and ensure safety in areas with high pedestrian and vehicle traffic.\n\n## Collaboration between entities for public order\n\nEntities like Cơ Quan Công An (public security agencies) collaborate with drivers to ensure national security and public order. This collaboration underscores the community's holistic approach to road traffic management, beyond just safety measures.",
